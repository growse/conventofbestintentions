<description>Hello dears!

Well, I&#x27;ve got to say how exciting this all is. Sister Josie has been up all hours on the INTERNETS making us this wonderful HOUSEPAGE and I feel truly blessed that we can take the Convent of Best Intentions forward into the 21st Century!

I&#x27;m not that sure what a BLOG is, but here I am writing one! It just shows how adaptable us nuns really are. And talking of adaptable, we&#x27;re really excited about our mission to find 101 USES FOR AN IRONING BOARD! You can&#x27;t find out more about that on our 101 Uses of an Ironing Board Page. Josie says that&#x27;s obvious and that I shouldn&#x27;t say that and I should stop typing and oh- I see.

Well, I&#x27;d best be off, dears, but in the meantime you can busy yourself by having a look around our WEBSIGHT. This technology really is exciting. Do get in touch if you have any questions- we&#x27;re always keen to make new friends!

Take care and be good,
